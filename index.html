                <p>
                    Hi, all! We have an update on the replays situation for you to read here. In short, we can recover all replays of ladder and tournament battles, and are doing our best to work on restoring challenges from after the 2020 backup was made. This will take some time, so we appreciate your patience and sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
                </p>
